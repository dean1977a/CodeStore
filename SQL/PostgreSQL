1.显示列数量
SELECT  count(*)  FROM  information_schema.COLUMNS   WHERE  TABLE_NAME = 'tag_type';

2.查询表的大小
select pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('table_name'));

3.统计各数据库占用的磁盘大小
SELECT d.datname AS Name,  pg_catalog.pg_get_userbyid(d.datdba) AS Owner,
    CASE WHEN pg_catalog.has_database_privilege(d.datname, 'CONNECT')
        THEN pg_catalog.pg_size_pretty(pg_catalog.pg_database_size(d.datname))
        ELSE 'No Access'
    END AS SIZE
FROM pg_catalog.pg_database d
    ORDER BY
    CASE WHEN pg_catalog.has_database_privilege(d.datname, 'CONNECT')
        THEN pg_catalog.pg_database_size(d.datname)
        ELSE NULL
    END DESC -- nulls first
    LIMIT 20


4.分箱统计
-- Bins created in Step 2
WITH bins AS (
      SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
             generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper),
     -- Subset stackoverflow to just tag dropbox (Step 1)
     dropbox AS (
      SELECT question_count 
        FROM stackoverflow
       WHERE tag='dropbox') 
-- Select columns for result
-- What column are you counting to summarize?
SELECT lower, upper, count(question_count) 
  FROM bins  -- Created above
       -- Join to dropbox (created above), 
       -- keeping all rows from the bins table in the join
       left JOIN dropbox
       -- Compare question_count to lower and upper
         ON question_count >= lower 
        AND question_count < upper
 -- Group by lower and upper to count values in each bin
 GROUP BY lower, upper
 -- Order by lower to put bins in order
 ORDER BY lower;

5.计算corr
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS correlations;

CREATE TEMP TABLE correlations AS
SELECT 'profits'::varchar AS measure,
       corr(profits, profits) AS profits,
       corr(profits, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(profits, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
  FROM fortune500;

INSERT INTO correlations
SELECT 'profits_change'::varchar AS measure,
       corr(profits_change, profits) AS profits,
       corr(profits_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(profits_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
  FROM fortune500;

INSERT INTO correlations
SELECT 'revenues_change'::varchar AS measure,
       corr(revenues_change, profits) AS profits,
       corr(revenues_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
       corr(revenues_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
  FROM fortune500;

-- Select each column, rounding the correlations
SELECT measure, 
       round(profits::numeric, 2) AS profits,
       round(profits_change::numeric, 2) AS profits_change,
       round(revenues_change::numeric, 2) AS revenues_change
  FROM correlations;
